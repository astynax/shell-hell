# Shell Hell ðŸ™ƒ

## What is it

One day I was thinking about a simple task: make a script-like program with proper CLI and pack it into a standalone executable. There was no particular need in the program itself, I just wanted to research as many ways to do it as possible â€” am I a language geek or not? ðŸ˜œ

Here I'm collecting examples made using stacks I tried so far. Below will be a complete list.

But first let's see the task's conditions.

### Task

1. Each program should be standalone, i.e. "download and run". Ideally, a single binary executable. Here I'm testing the **packaging**.
2. Program should have a rich Command Line Interface with inline help & stuff. Here I'm testing the expressiveness of **CLI-building libs/DSLs**.
3. Program should be able to call external programs and let me write such code easily. Here I'm testing the expressiveness of **shell-scripting capabilities**.

Each program expects a single argument â€” string prefix. Then it should run the pipeline `grep ^PREFIX /usr/share/dict/words | wc -l` that will count each word int dictionary that starts with the prefix. Yes, I usually can do such calculations  programmatically. But I want to be able to **compose existing tools** and wish to do it in a way as much close to bash/zsh/sh, as it possible in each language stack.

## Experiments

1. [Python](./python)
2. [Rust](./rust/)
3. [Haskell](./haskell/)
4. [Racket](./racket/)
5. [Kotlin](./kotlin/) (there is no native compilation yet, so this is a WIP/PoC)
6. [Swift](./swift/) (my first real swift program ðŸ™ˆ)

To be continued...
